                    <p> The Master Chief is a Spartan-II who went
                        and faught some crazy aliens know as the "Covenant". They
                        were pretty rad and dangerous, so the Master Chief came in
                        and faught against them till they were defeated. With the help
                        of him and the UNSC, which is the space navy, they won the war
                        and humanity was safe.

                    <p> The Halo games stem back all the way from Halo CE to Halo Infinite
                        currently. The first games were made by Bungie until Halo CE: Anniversery where
                        343 took over the mantle and still are the ones to this day.

                    <p> One of the artifacts that Halo is known for is their
                        collection of ICONIC weapons. Halo has weapons such as the assault rifle
                        , needler, plasma pistol, magnum, spnker rocket luncher, and much more in which
                        this franchise has accumulated.

                <h2>Did you know that ... </h2>
                <p> Halo was one of the first games I have played
                    since I was a kid. I first played on the xbox 360 and remember playing
                    games from Halo 3 to Halo 4 and had cherrished memories from that time
                    period.
